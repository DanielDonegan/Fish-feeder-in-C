Computer Science BSc year 2: Fish feeder:

This project contains a lot of code that was developed by Neale Snooke at Aberystwyth university. Here I have specified what code is mine:
  . 2024-2025_fish_C\main.c
  . 2024-2025_fish_C\fish.c Lines: 787/1193

This program simulates the environment of a robot developed by Neale Snooke for feeding his fish. This environment is simulated using a combination of JavaFX and C11
